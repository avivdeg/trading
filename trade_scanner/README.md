The script fetches data for S&P 500 stocks, calculates various technical indicators like CCI, RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, Stochastic Oscillator, and EMAs, and then applies some filtering criteria to identify potential trading opportunities.
Here's a breakdown of what the script does:

Imports required libraries: yfinance, pandas, and ta (technical analysis library)
Defines parameters like the CCI period, SMA periods, and market capitalization threshold
Sets weights for different technical indicators to be used in calculating a recommendation score
Fetches the list of S&P 500 tickers from Wikipedia
Defines a function get_stock_data to retrieve stock data and calculate various technical indicators
For each stock:

Downloads historical stock data from Yahoo Finance
Checks if the market capitalization meets the threshold
Calculates technical indicators like CCI, RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, ATR, Stochastic Oscillator, and EMAs
Determines the previous 3-day trend, last day candle type (bullish/bearish), and volume trend
Normalizes indicator values for calculating a recommendation score
Calculates a recommendation score based on the weighted sum of normalized indicators
Appends the stock data and calculated metrics to a list


Converts the list of stock data into a pandas DataFrame
Filters the DataFrame to keep only stocks that meet the following criteria:

Bullish candle on the last day
CCI between 0 and 100
Last closing price above all SMAs (20, 50, 150, 200)
Previous 3-day trend is up


Sorts the filtered DataFrame by Market Cap descending and then by Recommendation Score descending
Prints the filtered stocks to the console
Saves the filtered DataFrame to a CSV file
Prints the tickers of the filtered stocks as a comma-separated list
